# OPENAI API Onboarding

In order to get the best results, I used the tactics outlined in the documentation such as:
- Provide Examples/Reference text
- Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks

## Examples
{
  "quote": "The most valuable failure Iâ€™ve had here in Santa Cruz is getting a Reject/Resubmit of my submitted paper. It took me almost 3 months to redo my project and rewrite the paper. The paper together with the supplementary materials extended over 150 pages but they were much better than the previous version. The updated version got minor revisions and admirations from the editor and the reviewers. This experience makes me understand that I should pay more attention to my writing skills, image displaying, and preciseness in academic studies. We need to make our work good enough to get compliments from other mates. I am really lucky to learn this lesson before my graduation. Earlier is always better.",

    "academic editor": "We appreciate the academic editor for their insightful feedback, which encourages researchers to elevate their work and strive for excellence.",
    "peer reviewer": "We value the peer reviewers for their constructive criticism, which helps authors refine their papers and ultimately contribute to better academic standards."
  }
},
{
  "quote": "I think having a community that appreciates my interests and my intellectual outputs are really important for my sense of self worth, especially seeing other people also wrangling with difficult ideas along with me. This also extends to the community that opened up to me during academic conferences.",
  "type": "Academic & Professional Networks",
  "jobs": [
    {
      "jobTitle": "Academics",
      "summary": "We thank Academics for fostering an environment of intellectual support, encouraging the exchange of ideas, and promoting collaborative growth in scholarship."
    },
    {
      "jobTitle": "Conference Organizers",
      "summary": "We thank Conference Organizers for creating platforms that bring together diverse thinkers, enabling meaningful discussions and community building in academic circles."
    }
  ]
}

Compared to the website descriptions, this implementation is more direct and concise and address the parties involved directly.
